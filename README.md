#An artistic renadition of the classic Pong game. There are 2 balls in play. And an obstacle in the shape of a brick will 
#   choose a random location to be placed. If either of the balls hit the obstacle the ball will bounce off and the brick 
#   relocate to a new location. The balls will also reflect off of each other.

#List of Known Problems
#Collision detection can be wonky (between the balls)
#Pause function works 50/50 (Once the user presses pause the keyboard will always register it as being pressed down)
#  What you have to do is to hit the pause button (ESC) with a 1/60th of a second timing. Good luck.
#There is no end to the game. It just keeps on going.
